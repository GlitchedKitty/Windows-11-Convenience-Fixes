The following Powershell scripts fix/remove some of Windows 11's more annoying beatures.  These were originally written for my company's enterprise environment and Intune Policies, but they can be run as standalone scripts.
LegacyMenu - Enables the old Windows legacy right-click menu without having to click 'show more options'
AlignTaskbarLeft - Exactly what it says on the tin.  Aligns the items on the taskbar to the left.  Really only needed on fresh Win11 installs.
